## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to SQLAlchemy models in `app/models/`
2. Generate a new migration:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add user profile fields"
   ```
3. Review the generated migration in `alembic/versions/`
4. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

## Production Deployment

Migrations are automatically applied during Railway deployment via:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This is configured in the Railway startup sequence.
